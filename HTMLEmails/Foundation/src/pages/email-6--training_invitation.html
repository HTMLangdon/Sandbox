                    Hello Name,

                    I am looking forward to working with you and your team on [DAY], [MM,DD,YY] at [TIME]. This experience will help guide you
                    and your clients to success. We will go through a HECM Basics training presentation and have enough time
                    for questions and a tour of the ORMS portal at the end. Expect to be done by [TIME].
                </p>

                <p class="main-txt">
                    The morning of training, everyone who registered will receive an email with their user- name and password to start exploring
                    the portal. If you are able to take a look at the portal prior to training, feel free to come with any
                    questions.
