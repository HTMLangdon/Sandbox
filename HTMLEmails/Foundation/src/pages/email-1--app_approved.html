                <p class="main-txt">
                    Congratulations and welcome to One Reverse Mortgage Services! Your application for partnership with ORMS has been approved.
                    Please find your approval letter, W-9 form, and portal access form attached in this email.
                </p>

                <p class="main-txt">
                    The next step is to get a walkthrough of our easy-to-use portal and learn more about our business and products with an initial
                    training. Our wholesale trainer, Sharon Kerrigan, will contact you soon to set up a time that works best
                    for you. Please have those client or family member scenarios ready so that you get the most from this
                    training.
                </p>

                <p class="main-txt">
                    If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. We are excited to work with you!
