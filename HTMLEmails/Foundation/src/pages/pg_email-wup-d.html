                    Dear Name,
                </p>




                <p class="main-txt">
                    <em>
                        I want you to feel confident discussing the reverse with your client, so I've included the basic information you'll need
                        to explain the loan and answer any initial questions your client may have.

                    What is a reverse mortgage?
                </h2>

                <p class="main-txt">
                    Also known as a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) the reverse mortgage is a loan that allows your client to borrow money
                    based on the equity in their home. HECMs have added protection because these loans must meet HUD guidelines
                    and also are insured by the federal government. Just like any loan, the borrower still owns the home
                    and has requirements and obligations that are written into the loan agreement.
                </p>

                <h2 class="main-txt-heading">
                    What are the qualifications for both the borrower & the property?
                </h2>


                <p class="main-txt">
                    The borrowers must be 62 or older, own their home (be on title), and their home must be their primary residence. After completing
                    a loan application and counseling, they will also undergo a financial assessment. This is performed by
                    their underwriter to ensure the borrower can uphold the responsibilities of the loan. The property, which
                    is the collateral for the loan and the only required asset used to pay back the loan, must be a single-family
                    residence, FHA approved condominium or a 2-4 unit, owner occupied property.
                </p>

                <h2 class="main-txt-heading">
                    Counseling by a HUD approved counselor is required

                <p class="main-txt">
                    All borrowers, non-borrowing spouses, guardians, conservators, and power of attorneys are required to be counseled by a third
                    party, HUD-approved counselor. This can be done over the phone or face to face, in compliance with state
                    regulations. The signed and dated counseling certificate is required before loan processing can begin.
