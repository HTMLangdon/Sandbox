                    Hello Name,
                </p>

                <p class="main-txt main-txt">
                    Thank you for completing and submitting your One Reverse Mortgage Services partner application.
                </p>
                <p class="main-txt main-txt">
                    So, what happens now? We will review your application and reach out just as soon as your approval is complete. After confirming
                    your approval, we will walk you through our portal. In the meantime, please start to think of any clients
                    or family members you have that may be interested in the reverse mortgage program. During our walkthrough,
                    we can create different sample scenarios based on their information. These scenarios will provide examples
                    of how the reverse mortgage could work for them and will help you better understand the product.
                </p>

                <p class="main-txt main-txt">
                    We look forward to developing a great partnership together.
                </p>
