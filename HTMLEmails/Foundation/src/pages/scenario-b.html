            Richard & Edith 65 $600,000 $125,220 Age Home Value Existing Mortgage Balance Richard and Edith are looking at ways to enhance
            their retirement plan. Their financial advisor recommended that they consider a reverse mortgage line of credit.
            In reviewing their mortgage information, they discover they only have four more years to pay on their current mortgage.
            The balance owed is $125,220. They find out they qualify for a reverse mortgage line of credit for the amount of
            $251,400. The line of credit pays off their current mortgage leaving them with $126,180 available funds, after closing
            costs, on the day they open their line. They decide to continue making their monthly mortgage payments, which increases
            the amount of their available funds. In five years, after they pay the same amount they would've paid under their
            prior mortgage, the funds available on their reverse mortgage line of credit have grown to $368,708. This gives them
            money to access later in their retirement to use any time and any way they like. ￼
